## ðŸš€ **How to Run Each Lab**

### Prerequisites
To run the program, ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:
- **GCC** with OpenMP support
- **MPI** implementation (e.g., MPICH or Open MPI)
- **Python 3.x** with Matplotlib for graph plotting
- **Bash** (for scripting)

### General Steps:

1. **Clone the repository then navigate to the directory:**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/luckstraw/Paracomp.git
```
```bash
cd Paracomp
```

2. **Navigate to the specific lab directory:**
```bash
cd Lab1 # Replace with the lab folder you want to access
```

3. **Follow the README.md instructions inside each lab folder for setup and execution**
